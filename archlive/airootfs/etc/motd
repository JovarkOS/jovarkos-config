Welcome to JovarkOS Linux!

If you see this, and haven't been greeted with the installer or by GNOME, 
please note that this is a BETA release. Features may be incomplete, 
broken, or otherwise not working.

FAQ: 
Why didn't GNOME start?
 - This can happen for multiple reasons. You can start it manually by typing:
   systemctl start gdm

Why doesn't the installer start?
 - A file may be missing, or the installer may be broken. As of this writing, 
   one use the archinstall script to install Arch Linux, mount the target drive,
   then move configuration files from the live disk's /etc/ to /mnt/etc/.

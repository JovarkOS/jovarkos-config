# Configuration files for reproducible JovarkOS builds

Each folder contains a set of configuration files for a specific build. The `archlive` folder contains the configuration files for the headless Arch Linux Live ISO. *Please note that this is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.*

## Builds

*All builds come with the packages found in the [profiles/global_packages.x86_64](profiles/global_packages.x86_64) file.*


Please see the `packages.x86_64` file in each folder for a full list of packages for each desktop environment.

See [jovarkos-jbuild/](https://github.com/jovarkos/jovarkos-jbuild/) for more details on buiding.
